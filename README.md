# BhoomiPulse-Hackathon-2025
Hackathon project by Team BhoomiPulse â€” Robust Change Detection and Monitoring on User-Defined AOI using Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery.   Built for the Bhartiya Antariksh Hackathon, showcasing advanced environmental monitoring with NDVI and water change detection from satellite observations.


Project: Satellite Imagery Change Detection Web Application
Technologies: Python, Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Leaflet.js, Rasterio, NumPy, Pillow, GeoJSON

Developed a Flask-based web application to visualize, select, and analyze satellite .tif images for environmental change detection.

Implemented a dynamic image selection system with dropdown menus populated from local geospatial datasets.

Integrated interactive map rendering using Leaflet.js, enabling users to draw Areas of Interest (AOIs) for targeted analysis.

Built a server-side NDVI computation and change detection algorithm using Rasterio and NumPy to identify vegetation changes between two time periods.

Designed a REST API workflow for previewing images, submitting AOIs, and returning quantitative change metrics.

Created responsive UI with custom CSS for an intuitive user experience.
